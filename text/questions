in kthread_exit()
    - are we not supposed to set kt_state here?
        
in cleanup_child_proc()
    - pt_destroy_pagedir() is causing things to freak
      the fuck out. What should I do instead?

in kmutex_lock_cancellabe()
    - what happens if you were cancelled *before* locking the mutex?

------------------------------------------------------------

in tty_create()
    - I'm bad at C. Is it okay to use dot notation?

in tty_attach()
    - what does it mean to "allocate any memory you will need later"?
    - what should I initialize all the ints to?

in n_tty_receive_char()
    - how to I make it know when the buffer is full, vs. when I just started?

in n_tty_read()
    - what to do if we're cancelled? Is this significant? 
    - is CTRL+D just not put in the buffer?
