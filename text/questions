in cleanup_child_proc()
    - pt_destroy_pagedir() is causing things to freak
      the fuck out. What should I do instead?

------------------------------------------------------------

in tty_create()
    - I'm bad at C. Is it okay to use dot notation?

in n_tty_read()
    - what to do if we're cancelled? Is this significant? 
    - is CTRL+D just not put in the buffer?

in do_operation()
    - In step 3:
        - is this the right number?
        - am I doing this right?

in ata_read()/ata_write()
    - how do we figure out where next to write into the buffer?
    - is there a more specific error code that we need to return?
    - what happens if we try to read/write for a shitton of blocks?

in ata_intr()
    - Do I just call sched_wakeup_on()?

In general:
    - how do I test all of this?
