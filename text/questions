in vfs_syscall functions
    - just want to clear up the mutex thing again

-------------------

in vmmap_map()
    - do we need to do anything about vma_olink here?
    - is it okay to not set vma->vma_vmmap before calling
      mmap? we're also told to set the vma_vmmap field
      in insert.

in vmmap_read/vmmap_write()
    - should I be using pframe_lookup() instead of pframe_get()?

in anon_put()
    - what does it mean to uncache all of the object's pages?
      Flush them from the TLB?

in anon_lookuppage()
    - what should we return if we can't find the page?

in handle_pagefault()
    - are we supposed to flush the TLB after calling pt_map?

in general:
    - Why do we need copy_to_user() and copy_from_user()?

TODO 
    locking in s5fs.c :(
