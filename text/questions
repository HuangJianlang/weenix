in s5_seek_to_block()
    - what to do if seekptr is great than file length
      and we're not allocating?
    - where do we use pin() and unpin()?

in s5_link()
    - why do we need to call s5_find_dirent()?

in s5_read_vnode()
    - so do we just not initialize the vn_ops and device
    if the vnode is a special file? Is this done in
    init_special_vnode for us?

in s5_read/delete_vnode()
    - should we dirty the inode?

In general:
    - Should the pageoutdaemon have a cwd? If so,
    what should it be, and how should we set it?
