in vfs_syscall functions
    - just want to clear up the mutex thing again
-------------------

in vmmap_map()
    - do we need to do anything about vma_olink here?
    - is it okay to not set vma->vma_vmmap before calling
      mmap? we're also told to set the vma_vmmap field
      in insert.

in handle_pagefault()
    - what does "don't forget about shadow objects, especially
      copy-on-write magin!" mean?

-------------------

Potential bugs:
    - if s5_write_file() ends early b/c of an error, the file 
      size is still as if the entire write suceeded

    - Address space before/after list in vmmap_find_range
